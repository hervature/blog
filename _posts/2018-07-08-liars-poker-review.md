### Preamble

As this is my first book review, I will talk a bit about the format I intend to follow. The "reviews" won't so much be an evaluation of the book itself. I don't intend on giving a grade to individual books but I will make remarks as to how the book compares to other similar works. For example, as I have been reading lots of Michael Lewis, I will compare his books to each other so that someone who has read his other works and sitting on the fence of buying another book can more easily decide.

The reason that I think giving a score to the books is pointless is because I only intend on reading good books. At least, books that I know that I will enjoy. Instead, I will be focusing on giving a brief synopsis of the book. Probably at the chapter level for non fiction and whatever makes sense for fiction. I will then interleave my thoughts into these summarizations. This will serve two purposes: one, to give everyone a better look at the content. Two, to provide the readers with - hopefully - entertaining commentary that justifies you spending time on this blog. Some reviews will be better than others, so feel free to skip the ones that don't interest you.
