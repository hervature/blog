### Update

Nothing too new to report on this week. It was my second last week of my internship at Stratyfy which has been a great experience thus far. I am just wrapping up my final project there and getting ready to go to New Liskeard for the final week before the school year commences at Princeton. In terms of cycling, my body has fully recovered from that crash a couple of week ago. Just a few minor scrapes are visible. As a result, I went for a long ride yesterday which you can see [here](https://www.strava.com/activities/1797267563?utm_content=31130970&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=twitter #strava). A nice little 50 miler that fueled my love peanut butter but left the caboose a little tender. Which reminds me, I need to go buy a nice bib.

Until next week,

Zach
